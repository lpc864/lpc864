    Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹
</h1>

<p>
  
  I'm a third-year Computer Science student at the University of AlmerÃ­a. I have a passion for      programming, which I see as a form of art where I get to be the 
  artist. Every line of code I write is like a brushstroke on a canvas, creating something beautiful and functional from nothing

  <br>
  I love learning new things and am always on the lookout for new ideas and perspectives. My     
  curiosity drives me to explore different areas of computer science and technology. I believe 
  that there's always something new to learn and a new challenge to tackle
